# GitFlow Workflow Simulation
A comprehensive simulation of GitFlow workflow methodology to demonstrate team collaboration in real-world software development projects through virtual team members.

## üéØ Project Goal
To simulate and understand GitFlow workflow principles by creating a controlled environment with multiple virtual developers, demonstrating how teams collaborate in professional software development.
